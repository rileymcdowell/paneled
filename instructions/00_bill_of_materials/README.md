# The Bill of Materials

Below is a bill of materials required to build a 
complete PaneLED panel including lights an electronics.

You may want additional unlighted panels if you are 
acoustically treating a room. For that reason, the 
BoM has been divided into "construction materials"
and an "additional lighting materials". The lighting
materials are only required if you add lighting to 
the panels.

| **Construction Materials Total** | | | 1 | $54.26 | | Single panel cost | |

In summary, you're looking at about $60/panel if you don't include lights. You could cut that cost down significantly by choosing more thrifty fabric to wrap the front and sides. Whatever fabric you choose should be very breathable. You want air, and thus sound, to pass through the fabric and into the rockwool insulation inside.

In total, you're adding about $100/panel to include all the extras needed for lighting. 
A few notes about these materials:

* The ESP32 dev kits must be the 38 pin narrow version to fit the PCB design
  for this project. Unfortunately, this version is not the most common version
  available. The specific model you want is identifiable py the 19-pin 
  headers down the complete length of each side of the dev board, and no mounting 
  holes present of any kind. Compare with the assembly instruction photos before you buy.
* Don't be tempted by power supplies from other brands - reliability is often an issue 
  with knockoffs.
* Don't be tempted to order knockoff screw terminals and fan headers. You want 
  ones made of nylon to withstand the temperatures needed to solder, and cheap 
  knockoffs are sometimes made of other, cheaper plastics like ABS that melt
  when soldered.
* The 1% tolerance resistors are overkill in their precision, but so cheap you 
  might as well get them!
