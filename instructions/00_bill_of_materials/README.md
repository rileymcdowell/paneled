# The Bill of Materials

Below is a bill of materials required to build a 
complete PaneLED panel including lights an electronics.

You may want additional unlighted panels if you are 
acoustically treating a room. For that reason, the 
BoM has been divided into "construction materials"
and an "additional lighting materials". The lighting
materials are only required if you add lighting to 
the panels.

| **Construction Materials Total** | | | 1 | $54.26 | | Single Panel Cost | |

In short, you're looking at about $60/panel if you don't include lights. You could cut that cost down significantly by choosing more thrifty fabric to wrap the front and sides. Whatever fabric you choose should be very breathable. You want the sound to pass through the fabric and into the rockwool insulation inside.
