# Assembling the Custom Circuit Board

## Ordering Boards

There are a lot of options for custom PCB prototyping worldwide. I chose to order from 
[JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com) and was extremely impressed with the quality of boards I
received. 

Just drag and drop a copy of the PCB gerber file zip archive from `../../panel_control_pcb` 
into the JLCPCB webpage. I used all the default options except surface finish. For that,
I swapped to the ENIG surface finish for purely cosmetic reasons.

I placing the order and received PCBs less than a week later including overseas shipping.

## Ordering Parts

Check the [BoM](../00_bill_of_materials/README.md) for info on the required parts and where to obtain them. 
A combination of Amazon and DigiKey will get you everything you need except the custom PCB itself.

## Soldering

I strongly recommend soldering parts onto the PCB in the specific order noted below. When done in 
this order, you can simply set the PCB on a heat-resistant surface (I used a wood table) 
and let gravity hold the pieces in their proper position as you solder each one.
