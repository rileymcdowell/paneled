# Assembling the Custom Circuit Board

## Ordering Boards

There are a lot of options for custom PCB prototyping worldwide. I chose to order from 
[JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com) and was extremely impressed with the quality of boards I
received. 

Just drag and drop a copy of the PCB gerber file zip archive from `../../panel_control_pcb` 
into the JLCPCB webpage. I used all the default settings except surface finish. I opted
for the ENIG surface finish for purely cosmetic reasons.

I placing the order and received PCBs less than a week later including overseas shipping.
