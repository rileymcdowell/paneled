# Assembling the Panel

## Preparing the Boards

The wooden frame must be precisely sized to snugly hold the rockwool insulation 
inside by friction alone. The insulation is sized to work with United States 
customary units (inches) and the guide to the frame adopts the same conventional 
units. 

The insulation itself is sized so that two pieces stacked
vertically will friction fit between 24 inch on-center wall framing 
in an 8 foot tall wall framed with 2" x 4" lumber. To save on cost and 
weight, we'll use 1" x 4" pine boards but achieve an identical friction
fit. To do so, you'll want to cut the following pieces.

* 2 x 24 inch lengths of 1" x 4" lumber
* 2 x 47 inch lengths of 1" x 4" lumber

## Routing the Switch Plate 

One of the two 24 inch boards will need a hole routed out to allow the switch to pass through
between the outside and inside of the box. To do so, begin by tracing an outline of the 
switch onto the board.

When you are satisfied with your outline, drill a hole large enough to fit a router bit
I chose to route the holes using a dremel with router attachement in a dremel
drill press, so a small hole was sufficient.

Fire up the dremel router and route out the hole. Even with pine, I had
to go very slow to avoid overheating the bit.

My holes usually came out too small, so I would finish them with a file
to make them slightly oversized.

This is how it should look when you're done. There should be some
slop/play in the hole. You'll be tucking fabric along all four sides
of the switch, so don't worry if your hole ends up a little too big.

Later on in construction, I learned that the pine is quite soft and the
construction screws self-tap easily, even through the fabric.
Drilling pilot holes is entirely optional.

When you're done, one of the two 24 inch boards should be ready to mount
a switch.

## The Wooden Frame

The 24 inch pieces are the top/bottom of the frame, with the 47 inch pieces
sandwiched in between. Nominal 1" x 4" pine boards have an actual thickness of 
3/4 inch, so the center area should measure exactly 47 inches by 22.5 inches.
Rockwool is intended to fit this sized space.

The following ASCII art illustrates the correct layout.

```
-------------------------
|        24 inch        |
-------------------------
|    |             |    |
|    |             |    |
|    |             |    |
|    |             |    |
|    |    22.5"    |    |
| 47 |      x      | 47 |
|inch|     47"     |inch|
|    |             |    |
|    |             |    |
|    |             |    |
|    |             |    |
-------------------------
|        24 inch        |
-------------------------
```

In each corner, drill two holes through the 24 inch board into the 47 inch board
sized to accomodate a #8 1-3/4 inch construction screw. A 1/8" drill bit
is a good size for most #8 screws, and 2 inch hole depth is sufficient. 
After drilling the hole, use a countersink bit to create a
conical cavity to recess the construction screw head. Finally,
install the construction screw. The hole should look as shown 
below (with one screw insalled and one about to be installed).

## Installing the Electronic Box

Mounting the electronics box is really easy. Pick a side of the frame to be the "back".
Be sure to check the orientation of the panel mount switch - it only installs one way. If
you're doing multiple panels, you'll want to choose the same "back" on each one so 
the switches all face the same way.

Line the box up flush with the side you've chosen as the "back" and screw it down
with four 3/4 inch #6 construction screws, two per side. Pilot holes are not 
needed since the wood is so soft.
